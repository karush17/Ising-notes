For long, Deep Learning has been motivated by the design and implementation of physics-based methods such as Boltzmann Machines and energy-based distributions for probabilistic estimations. This blog post takes the idea of physical implementations in deep learning a step further and introduces Ising models. Ising models have been the fundamental aspect of computations and approximations in the machine learning community. In fact, the famous neural network being used for majority of machine learning applications is itself a specific case of an Ising model carrying out probabilistic inference using a boltzmann distribution (also known as the softmax activation in the machine learning community). We will look at the need for adopting Ising models in the machine learning community and their capabilities from a computational perspective. Additionally, the later sections of the post will dive deeper into the working and operation of the model along with its various components. 

<h3>Why the Ising Model?</h3>
The early 1920s saw physicists working on lattice structures which were intrinsically difficult to solve. These structures consisted of inherent computational properties and their dynamic behavior in different phases opened multiple questions about their physical and chemical characteristics. Naturally, solving these lattices became of interest to physicists who originally worked on lower dimensional models. Ernst Ising (below), a german physicist, solved the one-dimensional Ising Model in 1925 which was given to him as a problem by his advisor Wilhelm Lenz (below). Ising solved the model and indicated that no phase transitions occured between particles which would later be corrected for higher dimensions. Although Ising solved the one-dimensional model, the two dimensional square-lattice model is much harder to solve and was later looked at analytically by Lars Onsager in 1944. The two-dimensional can now be solved using transfer matrix method which is one of the many techniques used for solved lattices alongside quantum theory.
