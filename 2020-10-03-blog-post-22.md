For long Deep Learning has been motivated by the design and implementation of physics-based methods such as Boltzmann Machines and energy-based distributions for probabilistic estimations. This blog post takes the idea of physical implementations in deep learning a step further and introduces Ising models. Ising models have been the fundamental aspect of computations and approximations in the machine learning community. In fact, the famous neural network being used for majority of machine learning applications is itself a specific case of an Ising model carryin out probabilistic inference using a boltzmann distribution (also known as the softmax activation in the machine learning community).
