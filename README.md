Notes on Ising Networks for Deep Hierarchcical Reinforcement Learning

Complete the following-  
1. Literature Review(3+ pages for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning)  
2. Review of Physics papers on Ising Simulations (3+ pages, it needs to be written in an intuitive way)  
3. Introduction and Strenghts/Weaknesses of various approaches (not much work is done here so elaborate)  
4. Formulation of your approach (look at this later)
