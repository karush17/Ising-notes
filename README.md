Notes on Ising Networks for Deep Hierarchcical Reinforcement Learning

### Literature Draft (September)  
* Literature Review(3+ pages for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning)  
* Review of Physics papers on Ising Simulations (3+ pages, it needs to be written in an intuitive way)  
* Introduction and Strenghts/Weaknesses of various approaches (not much work is done here so elaborate)  
* Short blog summarizing the capabilities of Ising Models  

### Toy Implementation (October 1st Half)  
* Test on a toy problem (Mazelab and custom Gridworlds are a good choice)  
* Elaborate the details- Aim of the experiment, why this problem, setup, how was it done, what were the strenghts and weaknesses of the setting  
* Highlight the findings- First explain what has to been assessed and why. Then emphasize on results and their key findings, give an intuitive explanation, layout the details, etc.
